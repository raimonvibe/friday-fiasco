Ever felt that irresistible urge to deploy to production on a Friday afternoon? 😬 We've all been there! "Friday Fiasco" is a fun, interactive web game designed to humorously highlight why that might *not* always be the best idea. Meet "Friday," your charismatic weekend-loving guide, who will try to tempt you into one last push before the weekend. Will you resist, or will you dive headfirst into... the Fiasco? 🤪

## 😱 The Peril of Friday Deploys!

This game simulates the classic developer dilemma: the tempting shortcut of a Friday deployment versus the wisdom of waiting. Experience the potential chaos (like those dreaded 500 errors! サーバーダウン！) or the sweet, sweet relief of a stable production environment and a stress-free weekend.

## ✨ Features

* 😎 **Meet "Friday"**: Our star character! A super chill dude with sunglasses, slippers, and a cocktail, always ready to convince you "What could possibly go wrong?"
* ☀️ **Dynamic Visuals**: Enjoy a sunny, festive beach theme... until a bad push turns the scene into ⛈️ server chaos with red errors and crashing server icons!
* 🎮 **Interactive Gameplay**: Navigate a simplified work week and face the critical choice on Friday: to deploy or not to deploy?
* 😂 **Hilarious Animations & Dialogues**: If you choose to push, watch Friday gleefully "help" you into a fiasco! His lines are super relaxed and persuasive.
* 💡 **Educational Tips**: After a (simulated) deployment disaster, the app provides handy tips like "Always test in staging first" or "Plan deployments for Tuesday for less stress."
* 🏆 **Weekend Survival Score**: Keep track of how many times you've successfully resisted Friday's charm and earned a "Safe Weekend Badge."
* 😈 **Friday's Transformation**: Watch Friday turn from a laid-back buddy into a grinning prankster when things go south!
